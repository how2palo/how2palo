<p><b>Hi! Greetings 👋🏼 Nice to meet you!</b></p>
</div>

It is `Víctor Palomares` and I like to define myself as an `anarcho-pacifist` guy from `Catalonia`😎
  
> I believe in the power of `Education` (in both ways, `learning`&`teaching`) to overcome difficulties.
> I stand up for `Catalonia`, `Diversity`, `Arts`, `Technology`, `Privacy` and several more things.
> I like to spend time on `gaming stuff`, `music` (especially `Rap`), learning `languages`, following `One Piece` and watching `FCBarcelona` matches and things about `GNU/Linux`, `Pokémon` and the `Wizarding World` ✨
